# SENNSE-AR Spring Boot Microservice

This repository contains the **Spring Boot microservice** that acts as the core engine of the SENNSE-AR platform.  
It is designed to handle API requests, manage authentication, and execute business logic in a **modular, scalable, and maintainable** way.

---

## üéØ Objective

This README demonstrates how the microservice works and provides guidance on how to run and extend it in case you want to improve functionality.  

The service is built on **Spring Boot** and follows a **layered architecture** with clearly separated concerns for better maintainability.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into several main packages, each with its own responsibility:

### 1. **`component/`**
- Contains classes that rely on **Dependency Injection (DI)**.  
- Allows Spring to manage class lifecycle and automatically inject dependencies where needed.  
- Example use cases:
  - Defining reusable beans (e.g., base URLs, configuration values).  
  - Running scheduled tasks or event-driven actions.  
- **Example:**  
  A class that refreshes an **authentication token** every hour is injected into the Spring context. Thanks to DI, this process runs automatically without explicitly calling the class each time.

---

### 2. **`configurator/`**
- Holds configuration classes.  
- Works with **Spring‚Äôs DI mechanism** to centralize all configuration logic.  
- Example: Defining API keys, connection pools, or CORS rules.

---

### 3. **`controller/`**
- Contains REST controllers that define **API endpoints**.  
- Responsible for:
  - Exposing routes (e.g., `/sennse-ar/qr-code-generate`, `/sennse-ar/list-board/`).  
  - Handling HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  
  - Returning appropriate HTTP responses.  

---

### 4. **`model/`**
- Represents the **data model** used internally.  
- Acts as the schema for data manipulation, similar to how entities map to a database.  
- In this microservice:
  - Data is stored as **JSON objects** instead of relational tables.  
  - Models are designed to encapsulate the structure of this JSON-based persistence.  
- Provides a clean way to pass structured data across services.

---

### 5. **`payload/`**
- Contains **request and response objects**.  
- Implements the **serialization and deserialization layer** for APIs.  
- Benefits:
  - Ensures a strict contract between the frontend and backend.  
  - Makes request/response handling more robust and type-safe.  
- **Example:**
  - `SENNSE_JSON_GENERATOR_REQUEST` ‚Üí defines fields for JSON generator.  
  - `JSON_GENERATOR_POST_RESPONSE` ‚Üí wraps response HTTPStatus, Info Message and File Location. 

---

### 6. **`services/`**
- Contains the **business logic layer**.  
- Controllers pass requests to services, where actual computation and processing happen.  
- Example responsibilities:
  - Validating user inputs.  
  - Refreshing tokens and managing authentication.  
  - Generating QR codes or handling AR-related operations.  
- Keeps the system modular: services can be tested and extended independently.

---

## üîë Authentication

- For security, update the class **`SENNSE_AUTH_REQUEST`** with your backend credentials. 
- These credentials are required to let the microservice authenticate and run without errors.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not commit sensitive credentials to the repository** ‚Äî use environment variables or a secrets manager for production deployments.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Service

### Prerequisites
- [Java 17+](https://adoptium.net/)  
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)  
- (Optional) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerized deployment  

### Run Locally
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/SENNSE-AR-MS-SB.git
cd SENNSE-AR-MS-SB

# Build project
mvn clean install

# Run application
mvn spring-boot:run
```
### Run Locally
```bash
# Build the Docker Image
Docker build -t meddali/sennse-ar-springboot:latest .

# Run the Docker Image
Docker run -r 8433:8443 meddali/sennse-ar-springboot:latest
```

## üìñ Future Improvements
- Externalize authentication credentials into environment variables.
- Add persistent storage integration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or cloud DB).
- Expand unit and integration test coverage.
- Introduce CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
